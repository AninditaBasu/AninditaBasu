<h1>Javascript</h1>
<p>
These are javascript code for HTML files in your online help documents.
</p>

<p>If the final output of your online help files is HTML, you can include these code snippets in your HTML transforms. The files use the jQuery and the jQuery UI libraries, and are implemented through the "class" attribute of HTML elements. Therefore, the code will work on any element that takes a "class" attribute.</p>
<p>The following effects are ready for your use at the moment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For progressive disclosure, showing or hiding blocks of content on demand</li>
  <li>For usability, showing the content of a footnote on hover rather than on click (though click is still an option if preferred by the reader).</li>
  <li>For consumability, displaying the sections on a page in horizontal tabs instead of vertical sections</li>
  <li>.....</li>
  <li>Conref in HTML. No, I'm not there yet :) Will get there in a bit.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Python</h1>
<ul>
  <li><a href = "#wordlist">Word list scan: A script that reports the occurences of an entire list of words and phrases in DITA topic files in a directory</a></li>
  <li><a href = "#replink">Repeated links scan: A script that reports links that occur more than once in DITA topic files in a directory</a></li>
</ul>
<a name = "wordlist"></a>
<p>The script that scans all DITA files in a directory, recursively, for occurences of an entire list of words and phrases that you specify.</p>
<p>To run the script, you need Python 2.7.5.</p>
<h3>Usage instructions</h3>

<ol>
<li>Download the script to any folder on your computer.</li>
<li>Open the wordlist.txt file in Notepad and enter the words and phrases to be searched for. Each word or phrase should be on a new line. Do not enter a new line after the last item in this file. Save and close the file.</li>
<li>Double-click the script. When prompted, enter the full path of the directory to be scanned, for example, c:\documentation. Do not forget to enter teh trailing \ for the directory.</li>
<li>When the checking is complete, you see a message on the console: "Press any key to exit." Press any key.</li>
<li>Go to the folder where you saved the script. You see a file called ..... This is the report file for you to read and act upon. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>The script assumes that all DITA topic files have the .dita extension and all DITA map files have the .ditamap extension. If your files use the .xml extension, this script will not work.</p>

<h3>Download</h3>
<p>See <a href = "https://github.com/AninditaBasu/word-list-scan" target = "_blank">word-list-scan</a>.</p>

<a name = "replink"></a>
<p>
The script reports links that occur more than once in  any DITA topic file. For any specified directory, the script checks all links in a DITA file, and all links in DITA maps. It identifies cross-references that occur more than once, and reports them. Relationship tables, topicref collections, inline Xrefs, links in the related-links tag are all reckoned.</p>

<p>To run the script, you need Python 2.7.5.</p>

<h3>Usage instructions</h3>

<ol>
<li>Download the script to any folder on your computer. Double-click the script.</li>
<li>When prompted, enter the full path of the directory to be scanned, for example, c:\documentation.</li>
<li>When the checking is complete, you see a message on the console: "Press any key to exit." Press any key.</li>
<li>Go to the folder where you saved the script. You see a file called RepeatedLinks.html. This is the report file for you to read and act upon. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>The script assumes that all DITA topic files have the .dita extension and all DITA map files have the .ditamap extension. If your files are .xml files, this script will not work.</p>
