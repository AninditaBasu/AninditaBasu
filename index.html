<body>

<div>

  <h1>Code bits and other pieces</h1>
  
<p>For technical communication, mainly, but any communication, really.  All of the scripts and code snippets are in freely downloadable public repositories on GitHub.</p>

<ul>
<li>Javascript: Reusable code snippets for HTML and DITA files in product documentation</li>
<li>Python: Scripts to make the everyday life of a technical writer a wee bit easier</li>
<li>Infographics: Code to generate basic infographics from large data sets</li>
<li>Implementation examples: Websites that use these Javascript snippets</li>
</ul>

<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>
These are JavaScript code for HTML files in your online help documents.
</p>

<p>If the final output of your online help files is HTML, you can include these code snippets in your HTML transforms. The files use the jQuery and the jQuery UI libraries, and are implemented through the <code>class</code> attribute of HTML elements. Therefore, the code will work on any HTML or DITA element that takes a <code>class</code> attribute.</p>
<p>The following effects are ready for your use:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For getting rid of copy-paste, use content referencing in HTML</li>
  <li>For progressive disclosure, show or hide blocks of content on demand</li>
  <li>For usability, show the content of a footnote on hover rather than on click (though click is retained as an option)</li>
  <li>For consumability, display the sections on a page in horizontal tabs instead of vertical sections</li>  
</ul>
<p>See <a href = "http://aninditabasu.github.io/onlineHelp-javascript/" target = "_blank">JavaScript for online help files</a>. The entire repository is downloadable as a <code>.zip</code> file. Each JavaScript effect has its own modular set and can, therefore, be used separately or together.</p>

<h2>Python</h2>

<p>These are scripts to make the everyday life of a technical writer a wee bit easier.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href = "#wordlist">Word list scanner:</a> A script that reports the occurrences of a <b>list</b> of words and phrases in DITA topic files in a directory</li>
  <li><a href = "#orphan">Orphan files scanner:</a> A script that reports the files that are not called by the DITA files in a directory</li>
  <li><a href = "#replink">Extra links scanner:</a> A script that reports links that occur more than once in DITA topic files in a directory</li>
</ul>

<p>To run these scripts, you need Python 2.7.5. Download and install Python from www.python.org. You need Python only to run the script; you don't need to know Python to run the scripts.</p>

<hr>

<a name = "wordlist"></a>

<h3>Word list scan</h3>

<p>The script scans all DITA files in a directory, recursively, for occurrences of an entire list of words and phrases that you specify.</p>

<h4>Usage scenario</h4>

<p>You want to scan all files in a directory for several words, all at once. Maybe these words are a list of do-not-use words that your style guide specifies, but you don't have an automated word checker to look for such occurences. Maybe you want to know if you've used certain DITA tags in your files but do not want to run a system search for each tag, one by one. This script searches for multiple words at one go, and also phrases and DITA tags. You specify a list of words and phrases, and tell the script which directory it should scan. The script runs the checks and gives you a report that you can read and act upon.</p>

<h4>Download and installation</h4>

<p>See <a href = "https://github.com/AninditaBasu/word-list-scan" target = "_blank">word-list-scan</a>.</p>

<a name = "orphan"></a>

<h3>Orphan files scan</h3>

<p>The script scans all files in a directory, recursively, and reports the files that are not called by any DITA file in the directory.</p>

<h4>Usage scenario</h4>

<p>You have several image files, topic files, and other files in the directory but hesitate to delete them because you are not sure if any of these files are referenced by the DITA files in that directory.  You tell the script which directory it should scan. The script runs the checks and gives you a report that you can read and act upon to clean up your workspace.</p>

<h4>Download and installation</h4>
<p>See <a href = "https://github.com/AninditaBasu/orphan-scan" target = "_blank">orphan-scan</a>.</p>

<hr>

<a name = "replink"></a>

<h3>Repeated links scan</h3>

<p>The script reports links that occur more than once in  any DITA topic file. For any specified directory, the script checks all links in a DITA file, and all links in DITA maps. It identifies cross-references that occur more than once, and reports them. Relationship tables, <code>topicref</code> collections, inline <code>xref</code> tags, and links in the <code>related-links</code> tag are all reckoned.</p>

<h4>Usage scenario</h4>

<p>When DITA topics are transformed to HTML, the following links are auto-generated and inserted inside the topic:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Links to nested <code>topicref</code> elements in a DITA map file</li>
  <li>Links to topics in the same row in a relationship table</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, DITA topics might have the following links inserted manually in the topic:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Through an <code>xref</code> tag</li>
  <li>Through the <code>related-links</code> tag</li>
</ul>

<p>The net effect is, after the transforms, a topic might contain a link to the same target more than once. Maybe yours is a multi-writer team, maybe you inherited the files and haven't done a link check, maybe you yourself linked to a topic twice: once through a <code>.ditamap</code> file and once again through an in-topic related link.</p>

<p>This script will find all such links: links that occur more than once in a topic. The script will, then, generate a report for you. Read the report and delete the extra insertions.</p>

<h2>Infographics</h2>

<p>Sometimes, the inbuilt functions of Microsoft Excel and OpenOfficeCalc are sufficient for number crunching and chart drawing (click the Titanic infographic button). At other times, data needs to be processed first before it can be fed into a spreadsheet (see the Earthquake infographic, where number data was in string format in a tab-delimited text file).
<div class="dropdown">
  <button onclick="TitanicFunction()" class="dropbtn">Titanic infographic</button>
  <div id="TitanicDropdown" class="dropdown-content">
