Hi!

My name is Anindita Basu. I'm a technical writer. I make unfamiliar things look less frightening.

I write menu names, button names, option labels, dialog box headings, error messages, notifications, and every little thing you see on user interfaces.

I also write HowTos, tutorials, API references, admin and deployment guides, and other long-form text that you need to get a software up and running and to use it.

Sometimes, I make videos.

At other times, I draw wireframes and prototypes for user interfaces.

At all times, I remain curious. Because, that's what helps me write for you &mdash; my reader &mdash; you who will use my words to get your task done as fast as possible.
