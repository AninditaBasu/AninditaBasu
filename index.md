<p>I am a technical writer.</p>
<p>I write menu names, button names, option labels, dialog box headings, error messages, notifications, and every lottle thing you see on user interfaces. I also write HowTos, tutorials, API references, admin and deployment guides, and other long-form text that you need to get any software up, running, and usable.</p>

<p>At other times, I draw wireframes and prototypes for user interfaces.</p>
<p>At all times, I remain curious. Because, that's what helps me write for my readers - they who will use my words to get their jobs done as fast as possible.</p>
<p>And, I treat my document as code. I am a great fan of string interpolation, for example. My special area of interest is information architecture and content strategy.</p>
<p>Also, I am tool agnostic. Tools are a means...</p>
