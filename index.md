<h1>Anindita Basu</h1>
<p>Hi! I am a technical writer and editor. I make unfamiliar things look less frightening.</p>
<p>I write menu names, button names, option labels, dialog box headings, error messages, notifications, and every little thing you see on user interfaces.</p>
<p>I also write HowTos, tutorials, API references, admin and deployment guides, and other long-form text that you need to read to get a software up, running, and usable.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I make videos.</p>
<p>At other times, I draw wireframes and prototypes for user interfaces.</p>
<p>At all times, I remain curious. Because, that's what helps me write for you &mdash; my reader &mdash; you who will use my words to get your jobs done as fast as possible.</p>
<p>My special areas of interest are information architecture and content strategy. Also, docs as code.</p>
<p>Oh, and did I mention I'm tool agnostic? Tools are a only a means to an end, aren't they? Like, one can play chess even without the chess pieces... <span class="small">(you can watch the following video clip on mute if you don't know Hindi; sometimes, even language is a tool)</span></p>
