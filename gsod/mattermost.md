# GSoD proposal for Mattermost

Name of the project: Review and Refine In-Product Text
(work-in-progress, in discussion with GSoD mentors)

---

## 1. Classify the strings

Identify which of the [strings](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp/blob/master/i18n/en.json) are system console ones, and which ones are user-facing. Take up the user-facing strings for review at first.

## 2. Create a style guide for the strings

Define styles for capitalization, length, and word usage for strings used in menu items, action buttons, labels, headings, tooltips, errors, warnings, validations, notifications, and confirmations (see an example styleguide [screenshot](https://github.com/AninditaBasu/AninditaBasu.github.io/blob/master/gsod/Capture7.PNG)). Also, create guidance around the use of tokens (placeholders) in strings, especially composite strings. 

Aim to keep this guidance to one page of an A4-sized sheet, shorter if possible. Intention being, developers who actually write these strings should find the guidance quick and easy to use, plus, when followed, UI text will show consistency across all screens.

## 3. Review and refine the text

Based on the style guide created at #2.

### Duration

I donâ€™t yet know how many of the strings are user-facing strings (which is what I propose to take up for review in this project). I estimate that creating the style guide would take about 3 weeks (from draft to approval), and this work can be done simultaneously with categorizing strings as system strings or user facing. I propose to start with the assumption that project will be a standard-length project (3 months), where I take up only so many strings for review as can be possible within this time frame. 

Since I am already employed full time, I would be able to work only part of the day on this project. I am open to the possibility of a longer-duration project if you think my reduced working hours will need it.
