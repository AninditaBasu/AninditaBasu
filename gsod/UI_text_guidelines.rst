In-Code Text Guidelines
============================
This is the Mattermost style guide for in-code text. It acts as a reference for writers and editors to ensure that the text on the Mattermost UI is consistent and clear.

Note

The style guide is not intended to slow down or otherwise impede contributions, which are always welcome. No contribution will be rejected due to non-conforming style, although it might be edited.
