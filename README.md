# Hi :wave:

I am a technical writer and completely in love with my work :page_with_curl: :pencil2: 

GitHub is where I:

-  Teach myself to write code that'll help me try out my :bulb: docs-process ideas
-  Play around with APIs that are easy enough for a low-grade coder like me to use, and are related to my interest areas: :sparkles: languages, words, ancient history

Oh, and my name is pronounced like this :point_right: **ʌnɪndɪtɑː** (uh-nin-di-taa)
