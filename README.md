# Hi :wave:

I am a technical writer :page_with_curl: :pencil2: and completely in love with my work :relaxed: 

GitHub is where I:

-  Teach myself to write code that'll help me try out my documentation ideas.

-  Play around with APIs that are easy enough for a low-grade coder like me to use, and are related to my interest areas: languages, words, ancient history. 

-  Make my own APIs. I've ambitiously named this project as [Indica](https://github.com/AninditaBasu/indica), and have, at the moment, 2 of the 5 planned APIs up and running :eight_spoked_asterisk: :eight_pointed_black_star: I also plan to male a Mahabharat API but, at the moment, have only a query service up at [Mahabharat](https://mahabharat.onrender.com) :sparkles:

Oh, and my name is pronounced like this :point_right: **ʌnɪndɪtɑː** (uh-nin-di-taa)
