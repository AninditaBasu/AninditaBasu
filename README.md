# Hi :wave:

I am a technical writer :page_with_curl: :pencil2: and completely in love with my work :relaxed: 

GitHub is where I:

-  Teach myself to write code that'll help me try out my documentation ideas. 
At the moment, I am experimenting with this [docs as code](https://aninditabasu.github.io/docs-as-code/) idea, which I plan to extend to cover modular documentation :gear:

-  Play around with APIs that are easy enough for a low-grade coder like me to use, and are related to my interest areas: languages, words, ancient history. 
The two most recent things I made are  [Mercury](https://github.com/AninditaBasu/mercury), for translations, and [MBverse](https://mb-verse.herokuapp.com), for querying the Mahabharat :sparkles: 

Oh, and my name is pronounced like this :point_right: **ʌnɪndɪtɑː** (uh-nin-di-taa)
