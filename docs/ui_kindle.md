I am a heavy reader and I own a Kindle Reader. I don't like the user interface because it takes several taps to do common reading tasks such as browsing my library, jumping between pages of a book, or going back to bookmarks. The following wireframes show how I'd like my Kindle to be.

## Home page: Current UI

| List view | Grid view | Either view, with menu |
| --- | --- | --- |
|![Kindle list view](./images/k1.PNG) | ![Kindle grig view](./images/k2.PNG) | ![Kindle menu](./images/k3.PNG) |


## Home page: Proposed UI

<table>
<tr>
<td><h6>Bookshelf view</h6><img src = "./images/k1a.PNG" /></td>
<td><h6>Bookshelf view with menu</h6><img src = "./images/k3a.PNG" /></td>
<td>
<h6>Improvements</h6>
<ul>
<li>Less time to browse the library: 3x more books than list view and 4x more books than grid view</li>
<li>More user control: Go to a bookshelf non-sequentially through pagination at the bottom</li>
<li>Visual appeal: Bookmarks peeping from the books show current reading position rather than percentages</li>
<li>Less clutter:
<ul><li>Actions are moved to a hamburger menu on top</li>
<li>Most common action (Search) is separate, so needs fewer taps</li>
<li>Actions not relevant on a bookshelf page are removed</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Book-open page: Reading

<table>
<tr>
<td><h6>Current UI</h6><img src = "./images/k4.PNG" /></td>
<td><h6>Proposed UI</h6><img src = "./images/k4a.PNG" /></td>
<td>
<h6>Improvements</h6>
<ul>
<li>Visual appeal: Indicator of unread pages on either side of current page </li>
<li>Less clutter: Page number in 'Page X of Y' format for just-enough-information</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Book-open page: Menu options

<table class = "table">
<tr>
<td><h6>Current UI: Menu</h6><img src = "./images/k5.PNG" /></td>
<td><h6>Proposed UI: Menu</h6><img src = "./images/k5a.PNG" /></td>
<td><h6>Improvements</h4>
<ul>
<li>Less thumb strain: Most frequent actions are at the bottom, less frequent ones are at the top</li>
<li>Fewer taps: Common reading actions, such as notes and highlights are available upfront</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><h6>Current UI: More menu</h6><img src = "./images/k6.PNG" /></td>
<td><h6>Proposed UI: More menu</h6><img src = "./images/k6a.PNG" /></td>
<td><h6>Improvements</h6>
<ul>
<li>Less clutter: Actions not relevant to reading are removed from menu and pushed under the Home icon</li>
<li>Fewer taps: Easy to access bookmarks, notes, highlights, and do other common reader actions when a book page is open and is being read</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
