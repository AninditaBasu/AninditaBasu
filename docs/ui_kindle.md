I am a heavy reader and I own a Kindle Reader. I don't like the user interface because it takes several taps to do common reading tasks such as browsing my library, jumping between pages of a book, or going back to bookmarks. The following wireframes show how I'd like my Kindle to be.

## Home page: Current UI

| List view | Grid view | Either view, with menu |
| --- | --- | --- |
|![Kindle list view](./images/k1.PNG) | ![Kindle grid view](./images/k2.PNG) | ![Kindle menu](./images/k3.PNG) |


## Home page: Proposed UI

| Bookshelf view | Bookshelf view with menu |
| --- | --- |
|![Bookshelf view](./images/k1a.PNG) | ![Bookshelf view with menu](./images/k3a.PNG) |

### Improvements

-  Less time to browse the library: 3x more books than list view and 4x more books than grid view</li>
-  More user control: Go to a bookshelf non-sequentially through pagination at the bottom</li>
-  Visual appeal: Bookmarks peeping from the books show current reading position rather than percentages</li>
-  Less clutter:
    -  Actions are moved to a hamburger menu on top</li>
    -  Most common action (Search) is separate, so needs fewer taps</li>
    -  Actions not relevant on a bookshelf page are removed</li>

## Book-open page: Reading

| Current UI | Proposed UI |
| --- | --- |
|![Current UI](./images/k4.PNG) | ![Proposed UI](./images/k4a.PNG) |

### Improvements

-  Visual appeal: Indicator of unread pages on either side of current page </li>
-  Less clutter: Page number in 'Page X of Y' format for just-enough-information</li>


## Book-open page: Menu options

| Current UI: Menu | Proposed UI: Menu |
| --- | --- |
|![Current UI: Menu](./images/k5.PNG) | ![Proposed UI: Menu](./images/k5a.PNG) |

### Improvements

-  Less thumb strain: Most frequent actions are at the bottom, less frequent ones are at the top</li>
-  Fewer taps: Common reading actions, such as notes and highlights are available upfront</li>

| Current UI: More menu | Proposed UI: More menu |
| --- | --- |
|![Current UI: More menu](./images/k6.PNG) | ![Proposed UI: More menu](./images/k6a.PNG) |

### Improvements

-  Less clutter: Actions not relevant to reading are removed from menu and pushed under the Home icon</li>
-  Fewer taps: Easy to access bookmarks, notes, highlights, and do other common reader actions when a book page is open and is being read</li>
