Collections
============

Things on Internet Archive are called `items`. A song, a book, or a video is an item. Every item can have one or more files. For example, an item called `Euclid's Geometry` can have a `PDF` file, an `HTML` file, and a `TXT` file.

Every item has a unique identifier.

Every item always contains the following two files:

- <unique_identifier>_meta.xml, which ...
- <unique_identifier>_files.xml, which ...

Additionally, every item can contain files and folders. The following diagram shows the structure of an item called `...`.

All items must meet the following conditions:

- 100 GB or smaller
- 10,000 files or fewer

Items can be placed in collections. For example, a collection called `European Libraries` can contain several items, one of which can be `Euclid's Geometry`. An item can belong to more than one collection.
