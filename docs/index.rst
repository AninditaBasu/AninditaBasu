Doc Tools
===============

These are some tools for your day-to-day documentation tasks, especially if you use DITA.

- Word List Scanner: Scan all DITA files in a directory recursively for occurrences of an entire list of words and phrases.
- Third Twin Scanner: Scan a directory recursively to identify duplicate, triplicate, or n-cate topic-to-topic links in DITA files.
- Orphan Scanner: Scan a directory recursively to identify files that are not referenced by any DITA file in that directory.
