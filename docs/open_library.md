# Open Library services

Open Library offers a suite of APIs to help developers get up and running with our data. This includes [RESTful APIs](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/restful_api), which make Open Library data availabile in JSON, YAML and RDF/XML formats. There's also an earlier, now deprecated [JSON API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/json_api) which is preserved for backward compatibility.
