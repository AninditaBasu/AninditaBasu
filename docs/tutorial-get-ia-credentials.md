# Get your Internet Archive credentials

Many of the operations on the Internet Archive database can be done freely without any authentication or authorization. However, some operations, such as the ones listed below, need keys:

- IA-S3 keys, for uploading, searching, and modifying metadata
- `archive.org` logged-in cookies, for downloading access-restricted content and viewing your task history

This tutorial shows you how to get your IA-S3 keys.

## Prerequisites 

You need `archive.org` login credentials. If you don't have an account yet, go to [https://archive.org/account/login](https://archive.org/account/login) and sign up.

## Steps

1. Go to [https://archive.org/account/s3.php](https://archive.org/account/s3.php) and log in.
1. Select the checkbox and click **Generate New Keys**.
1. Make a note of the two keys you're given: the access key and the secret key.

## What to do next

- Use the keys to upload an item to the Internet Archive. See [Create an item](tutorial-create-item.md).
